# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-Deep-Residual-Transfer-Learning
This model uses deep learning to identify Diabetic Retinopathy in the retina fundus images and classify them into healthy or Diabetic Eye.
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that targets the eyes by damaging the retinal blood vessels. Initially it is asymptomatic 
or causes fluctuating vision problems. As it becomes severe, it affects both the eyes and eventually causes partial or complete vision loss. 
Primarily occurs when the blood sugar level is unmanageable. Therefore, the person with diabetes mellitus is always at a high risk of acquiring
this disease. The early detection can deter the contingency of complete and permanent blindness. Thus, requires an efficient screening system.
The present work considers a deep learning methodology specifically a Residual based Convolutional Network ResNet, which is applied for
the early detection of diabetic retinopathy.
